          <h2>Golden Ratio</h2>
          <p>Web pages have a more classical and balanced look when UI designers use the golden ratio in their designs. These designs just look better and provide a more pleasing experience to the users. Text, images, navigation bars, buttons, etc can all be placed in golden rectangles that provide a “golden” design. Users feel more comfortable when interacting with different parts of the website because proportions are similar to works of art, nature and classical buildings.

        <h2>Golden Ratio</h2>
            <p><span id="definition">The golden ratio is a special number that equals approximately 1.618, it appears in art, geometry, architecture and web design. In web development it provides websites with a well-balanced look that appears perfectly proportional.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="overview">
          <p>As you can see in the first example with the webpage about fences, it displays a poor example of the golden ratio. The boxes in the site are unproportionable to the other elements on the page.  The space between the body of the website and the header/sidebar doesn’t use the golden ratio. The body needs to be 1.618 times larger than the sidebar/header.</p>
          <p> The second example (Mashable Website) the golden ratio is effective here, as it gives a very focused and driven website but also a good breathing space. Although some websites display the golden ratio with a more densely packed look of boxes, Mashable is able to show us how it can still be applied with more space. As you can see, the yellow lines in the picture show how and where the golden ration is being applied.
