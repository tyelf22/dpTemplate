          <h2>Framing</h2>
          <p>When we use framing techniques on our websites it is important to make sure we use the correct form of framing. We should use positive framing to lead someone to make a purchase and a negative frame to lead someone to inaction. For example, if our site was all about having someone sign a petition to legalize euthanasia in the united states we would use positive framing to lead the user to action to sign the petition. If we had a page that was against euthanasia we would use negative framing to promote them not to take action. It is important that you donâ€™t use a mixture of the two or the audience is more than likely going to use their own intuition on what route they should take.

        <h2>Framing</h2>
            <p><span id="definition">a technique that is used to help sway someone in the direction you want by the way you display information to them about a particular subject.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div class="overview">
          <p>As you can see in the first example, this pictures shows how framing can be used in both directions towards a particular audience. It can be seen as either negative or positive depending on your political beliefs or geographical location. These are two separate media groups that are able to display to their audience either a positive or negative action towards the university that supplied a scholarship to this undocumented individual. </p>
          <p> The second image shows just how easy it is to sway someone towards what you are trying to get them to do. If you tell people the if you eat candy then you will be fat. With that statement you can assume the only thing that the audience is getting from that is that if they eat candy they will in fact be fat. So maybe they stop eating candy but there are so many other factors that can play into someone gaining weight. But if the goal was to get the audience to quit eating candy then you will have probably been successful. If you goal is to promote someone to eat healthy and tell them they will get skinny by doing so then they will probably eat more fruit. The main thing to take away from this that although these statements might not be entirely true, they are trying to sway the audience in a direction that they want them to take. These are both great examples of framing and how you can implement framing into your designs. </p>
