          <h2>Color</h2>
          <p>It is important that the color you decide to use in your page has an overall easy color scheme that isn't overwhelming. When you are using more than 5 color on your page it can have an overwhelming effect that will confuse your visitors. There are certain color schemes that should be practiced to give your page an aesthetically pleasing design (Analogous, Complementary, Triadic, Quadratic).
          </p>
          
          <p>If you use the correct colors your page will be able to efficiently communicate the purpose of your site. If not, users can become confused and will often leave the site with no intention to return.</p>

        <h2>Color</h2>

      <div class="overview">
          <p>As you can see in the first image the color scheme is awful. They are not practicing any sort of good color combinations. As you can see they are also using way too many colors for one page. You really shouldnâ€™t have more than 5 colors on the site. Since there are so many colors it is hard to depict what elements are interactive and what the main part of the page is.</p>
          <p> The second picture gives us a good example of a monochromatic color scheme. They are using similar colors with different shades. Although it can sometimes be tricky to use a monochromatic color scheme this page looks beautiful. Each of the shades represent a certain part of the page which makes it easy to see what the main part of the page is and what parts are used for navigation. </p>
