          <h2>Good Continuation</h2>
          <p>When you practice good continuation, it helps organize your page in a manner that doesn’t confuse your visitors. Good continuation involves making sure the elements on the page are grouped together in straight lines or a smooth curve.  These particular groupings help make sure that your page has easy perceptibility that doesn’t lead to confusion.

        <h2>Good Continuation</h2>
            <p><span id="definition">Good continuation is the practice of being able to group elements in straight lines or smooth curves to enhance perceptibility.</span></p>

      <div class="overview">
          <p>In the first image you can see the webpage has elements all over the homepage that don’t seem to relate to one another. Even those these elements do correlate to one another, the designer practiced poor continuation. The navigation bar items don’t follow a straight line and look more like a scattered mess. Even the main content of the page leads to confusion due to the lack of good continuation.</p>
          <p> On the second image you can see the webpage is very well organized with straight lines and even some subtle smooth curves that makes it easy to follow. My eyes are led in a straight line that helps direct me along each visible segment. You can easily tell that each element on the bottom of the page are grouped together because it follows a straight line. Then as you can see on the top navigation bar it follows the same practice.  </p>
